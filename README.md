# Homemade.js
C-like javascript preprocessor & grunt task. Include, define, put, conditions.

## API
Fully compliable with preprocessor.js and more.
```javascript
//#include ./inc/file.js

//#define TEST=123

var a = /*#put "'" + TEST + "'" */;

```

## Use: CLI
`node homemade.js path/to/source.js path/to/destination.js`

## Use: Grunt-task
Gruntfile.js
```javascript
//config
...
homemade: {
	js: {
		src: 'build/build.jquery.js',
		dest: 'jquery.<%= pkg.name %>.js',
		context: {
			pluginName: "<%= pkg.name %>"
		}
	},

	otherJs: {
		src: '<config:concat.dist.dest>',
		dest: '<%= concat.dist.dest %>'
	}
}
...

grunt.loadNpmTasks('homemade');
//Add "homemade" task
```

## Use cases

* Build jquery-plugins, components, wrappers, amd modules etc. easier and more clear way than concat
* Precalculate some values. It may result in faster code than if it is calculated runtime.
* Code-generation

## Note
This plugin was created as a fast replacing of preprocessor.js, preprocess.js etc, due to absence of necessary building features, like define, put etc. It is very insecure, has potential bugs and doomed to be replaced in future by the better preprocessor.
